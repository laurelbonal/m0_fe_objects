# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I think mod0 has gone well, i am really enjoying the challenges. Im realizing most of my errors are syntax or typing errors, so i need to practice typing with intent going forward and really paying attention to detail. luckily most of my errors have been easy to identify when i try to run the code. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
ive realized that some days i can sit in front of the computer for hours and remain focused and clear minded, and other days i need to take a break every 15 minutes or so. I need to give myself grace on the days where the latter is the case. Im not going to get it faster by forcing myself into super uncomfortable situations.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
ive learned about objects, i want to remember how to pout objects into an array and i need to remember keys vs values and how to call upon them
